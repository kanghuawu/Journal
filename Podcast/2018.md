### InfoQ (Engineering Culture) - 1/5 - Ramon Harrington of Vistaprint on Choosing What Not To Build

* [source](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/Ramon-Harrington)

#### Highlights:

* Putting engineers in front of customers and having conversations results in far better understanding and empathy for the customer’s needs
* Be prepared to launch before you’ve built everything you think the product needs in order to avoid building features people don’t want
* Launching early with a reduced feature set can result in more engaged customers because their important problems are addressed first, and the product will be improved incrementally

#### Highlights:

* The underlying issues are not that complicated – we’ve got customers who have needs that they can’t explain and are rapidly changing, so we need ways to deliver products and experiment rapidly to enable us to learn and adapt to the emergent needs
* The unicorn organisations are not successful because of their technology; it’s because they have served their customers better than the traditional businesses did
