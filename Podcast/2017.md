#### Highlights:

* First append in-memory and dump to disk
* B-tree: 'A Btree, at it's write-throughput limit, requires two-IOs per random key blind-write.'
* Merge-Sort

### InfoQ (Engineering Culture) - 10/22 - Andrea Goulet & M. Scott Ford on the Marriage of Communication & Code

#### Highlights:

* Conway's law: organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
* Empathy: To be understood, first to understand (from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People)


### WSJ - 10/22 - Bitcoin Hack: Is Your Computer Making Cryptocurrencies?

#### Highlights:

* Hacker uses ordinary users' computer to outsource computational load.
* Hack or outsourcing? Even new business model? Ex: Media ask user do some computation in order to read news.

* [bean](https://beam.apache.org)
* [flink](http://flink.apache.org)

#### Highlights:

* Google Dataflow, Apache Beam
* Avoid running blocking REST calls from within a stream processing system - have them asynchronously launched and communicate over Kafka queues
* Running the fast data platform is easily launched on an existing or new Mesosphere DC/OS runtime

### InfoQ - 12/8 - Gremlin Releases 'Resilience as a Service' SaaS Platform to Enable More Effective Chaos Engineering

* [gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com)

#### Highlights:

* Undo and safety: 'Gremlin provides an 'undo' button and automatically cleans up if things go wrong.'
* Testing minimum unit and test at scale: Minimum units can be one lambda function, one container, one instance...

### InfoQ (Engineering Culture) - 12/9 - Conal Scanlon on Monte Carlo Mapping

* [source](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/Conal-Scanlon)

#### Highlights:

* Monte Carlo simulation projects likely completion based on past history rather than future guesses
* A forecast is a point in time situation â€“ as teams get better at delivery their predictability should improve
