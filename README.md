# Podcasts, Meetups and Books

This repository is like a journal documenting knowledgable podcasts, meetups and books I enjoyed. I don't keep a very detailed journal but scrappy notes so I know where/what I can lookup later. Each category is subdivided into years.

Meetup groups I attend quite often:
* [Silicon Valley Java User Group](https://www.meetup.com/sv-jug/)
* [SF Big Analytics](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Big-Analytics/)
* [San Francisco Python Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/sfpython)

Podcasts I listen to on regular basis:
* [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com)
* InfoQ Culture (same link as above)
